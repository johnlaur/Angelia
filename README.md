Angelia is a software defined radio transceiver board made by Apache-Labs based on enhancements to the OpenHPSDR Hermes. Compared to Hermes, Angelia adds:

* A larger FPGA
* Larger EEPROM for FPGA code
* 32mbit SRAM
* A second LTC2208 ADC

Angelia is sold by [Apache-Labs](http://www.apache-labs.com/) as a standalone board and as part of the ANAN-100D amateur radio. The firmware was originally derived from code developed for HPSDR Hermes.

Official firmware releases including source code are made by Joe Martin, K5SO and [available at his website.](http://k5so.com/HPSDR_downloads.html)

This repository provides a way to browse the official source code and visualize the changes between releases without installing Altera's Quartus II development tools.
